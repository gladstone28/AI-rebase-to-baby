QUESTION: Can you explain to me like you are explaining to a baby how to use git rebase

ANSWER: Sure! Let's imagine using Git Rebase is like making a sandwich. Here's how it goes:

Step 1: Start with the Bread
Think of the main branch, called "main" or "master," as the bottom slice of bread in your sandwich. This is the foundation where everything starts.


Step 2: Add Your Toppings (Your Changes)
Now, you have your own branch with your changes. Let's call this your "feature" branch. Your changes are like the toppings you want to add to your sandwich – maybe some cheese and ham.

Step 3: Make Sure Everything Matches
Before you add your toppings to the sandwich, you want to make sure the bread (the main branch) is up to date. So, you go and get the freshest bread. This is like making sure your main branch has the latest updates.

Step 4: Rebase – Putting Your Toppings on the Fresh Bread
Rebasing is like taking your toppings (your changes) and putting them on the freshest slice of bread. You carefully place your cheese and ham on the new, fresh bread. This means you are taking your changes and putting them on top of the updated main branch.

Step 5: Enjoy Your Sandwich
Now you have a nice, fresh sandwich with your delicious toppings on it. In Git, this means your feature branch has the latest updates from the main branch and includes your changes.
